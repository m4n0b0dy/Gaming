       "  'description': \"At the heart of our Galaxy, an advanced civilization of which we know nothing has built the biggest, most beautiful starship ever, the Starship Titanic. Majestic and luxurious, its interior resembles a mixture of the Ritz, the Chrysler building, Tutankhamen's tomb and Venice. Starship Titanic is a technological marvel. And it cannot possibly go wrong. In theory. Seconds into its maiden voyage it crashes into hyperspace, vanishes... ... and collides with your house. Bewildered, you find your way aboard, and just as you are gazing at its awe-inspiring interior, the ship takes off again and heads deep into space. You are stranded. But you are not along. The ship is inhabited by a crew of malfunctioning robots and a semi-deranged parrot. You discover that you can communicate with them, a feat that is made possible by SpookiTalk, the games proprietary interactive language engine. You can chat with any of the robot characters, like Fentible the distinguished Doorbot, Nobby the hypochondriac Liftbot, or Fortillian Bantoburn O' Perfluous the outrageously convivial Barbot. Talk to them. Interrogate them. Give them orders. They will listen to you, answer you and, if they happen to feel like it, obey you. Sometimes.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Not a video game but an interactive educational program, Cyber Deer allows a computer user to shoot an anatomically accurate whitetail from any user-selected height, distance or angle, using bow or firearm settings, and then analyze the shot\\'s internal path through the deer. After \"firing,\" the user\\'s shot-path is highlighted and remains on the screen while the user zooms in and rotates the deer to see the entry and exit path up close. Then, the user can strip away layers, starting with the skin, to see how the shot-path affects the skeleton and internal organs of the deer. After stripping away the skin and skeleton, a user can then individually remove the stomach, diaphragm, liver, lungs and heart to study which organs were affected. Meanwhile, continue to rotate the image or zoom in or out for detailed analysis.\\n\\nHave you ever wondered how height and angle affects shot placement for a bowhunter? What about where to aim on those quartering-away shots? Where should you aim to hit the heart? All of these questions can be answered with Cyber Deer. Additionally, while the Cyber Deer program will allow you to take a shot from any angle you want to try, it will also tell you when a shot angle you chose is not advisable and less likely to be effective.\\n\\nVeteran hunters will benefit from Cyber Deer, and it will also be a fantastic tool for anyone teaching others about ethical hunting and effective shot placement, including parents teaching their children, mentors teaching new hunters, and hunter-education instructors. Cyber Deer can easily be shared with groups by using a PowerPoint projector.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. It is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide in homes, parks, clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments.\\n\\nEach player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently. Pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, with the objective to 'checkmate' the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. In addition to checkmate, the game can be won by the voluntary resignation of the opponent, which typically occurs when too much material is lost, or if checkmate appears unavoidable. A game may also result in a draw in several ways, where neither player wins.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Game Informer Review\\n\\nAs renowned as the Final Fantasy series has become over the years, the release of Crystal Chronicles brings with it an air of unfamiliarity. Although many of its elements tie into the greater Final Fantasy universe, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.\\n\\nWhile it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best from Final Fantasy, and with each passing release, Square has delivered. Crystal Chronicles may break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren. \\n\\nAs stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. The Final Fantasy games are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought in Crystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably absent.\\n\\nThe gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Product Description\\n\\nReview\\nDo you want to party like it\\'s 1979? Well pull up a seat grasshopper, and get ready for Kung Fu Chaos, a silly but fun party game that\\'s basically a kung fu movie simulator. You pick one of eight fighters to \"act\" in various fighting scenes interspersed with party games--think Powerstone meets Fusion Frenzy. After a scene is finished, you can replay the level as a 1970\\'s kung fu movie, complete with commentary from fictional movie director Shao Ting. \\nKung Fu Chaos has solid single and multiplayer play. In single player mode, you can play the Ninja challenge, which pits you against a clan of mysterious evil Ninjas. If you unlock enough areas in the Ninja Challenge, you can choose a character and jump into the single player Miniseries challenge, which has unique tasks for each character. If you opt for multiplayer, you\\'ve got the 12 level Championship game, where up to four human players can duke it out. There are also Battle Game, Freestyle, and Rehearsal modes, which can be played in either single or multiplayer. \\n\\nThe graphics and music are decent, not extraordinary. The game has a fun deformed-cartoon style, and the music includes both the theme from Enter the Dragon and Kung Fu Fighting. The voice acting is good too, especially during cut scenes and when characters taunt each other. The frame right stays smooth no matter how many characters are on the screen, which is good, but sometimes there is so much fast action on the screen (especially during multiplayer play), that you can easily lose track of your character.',\n",
